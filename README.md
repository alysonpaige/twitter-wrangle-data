# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Analysis

## Introduction
[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. For this project, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats related to this Twitter account. Then, assess the quality and tidiness, and clean it. Finally, wrangling efforts will be showcased through analyses and visualizations.
